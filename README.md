ClassifyGenius is an interactive machine learning application built using the open-source Streamlit framework. It is a simple web application that enables users to explore different datasets and classifiers. The application allows the user to select from three popular machine learning algorithms: K-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest. It also allows the user to adjust the parameters of the selected classifier with a scrollbar. As the user changes the parameter, the accuracy changes, and the application updates the overview of the dataset, classifier, and accuracy, along with a plot of the dataset.

The application offers three datasets to choose from: Iris, Breast Cancer, and Wine. Users can choose the dataset they want to explore and visualize by selecting it from the dropdown menu. ClassifyGenius displays a summary of the dataset, such as its shape and the number of classes in the dataset. The user can also choose a classifier from the dropdown menu, and the application displays a scrollbar to adjust the classifier's parameters.

The app also offers a plot of the dataset, which the user can use to explore the data visually. The plot updates as the user selects a different dataset or classifier. For example, the user can select the Iris dataset, and the application transforms the data into two dimensions and plots it. If the user selects a different dataset, such as Breast Cancer, the plot updates accordingly.

ClassifyGenius offers an intuitive and straightforward interface that enables users to explore the different machine learning classifiers and datasets. Users can play around with different parameters to see which combination offers the best accuracy for the selected dataset. The application is an excellent tool for anyone interested in learning about machine learning algorithms or for anyone who wants to experiment with machine learning classifiers.
